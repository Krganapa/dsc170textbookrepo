### About This Course 
Welcome to the world of Spatial Data Science! This course will introduce you to spatial data science concepts and present you with a range of spatial data management techniques and spatial analysis methods. You will learn how to find, interpret, visualize and analyze spatial data and build models involving such data. GIS software and several Python packages will be used to illustrate core concepts and techniques, and you will learn how to apply such spatial analysis techniques on real datasets. ### Prerequisites DSC-80 (Practice of Data Science). More generally, we will assume that you know how to program in Python and use packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy. Familiarity with “non-spatial” data science approaches and tools would be a big plus. 

### Textbook and Resources 
This is the official course Textbook! We shall set up accounts on UC San Diego's [Jupyterhub](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/) to help students develop code for Programming Assignments for those who are officially enrolled in the course. To install resources on a local machine please refer to the instructions on the [Resources](../resources/localinstallation.html) section.
